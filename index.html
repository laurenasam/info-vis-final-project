    <h1>The Data Dilemma: How Personal Information is Collected, Used, and Protected</h1>
    <h3> By Lauren Asam and Micheal Mitchell</h3>
    <h2>A Brief Overview of Growing Concerns About Data Privacy in the Digital Age</h2>
    <p>With better technology, data is becoming one of the most valuable resources in the world. But these data-driven advancements come with a cost: people are losing their privacy. Every time you do something online, including liking a post, shopping on an app, or just browsing through a website, you leave a digital trace. These footprints may seem to be no big deal, but companies collect, keep, and sell this information without users' knowledge.
        Data privacy is a problem that goes beyond individual concerns. Data breaches, such as the 23andMe incident in 2023, where “credential-stuffing attacks” exposed genetic data for over 6.9 million individuals, highlighting how vulnerable personal information is when it ends up in the wrong hands (“23andMe Data Breach Exposes Genetic Information of Millions”). In addition to compromising people's identities, these breaches destroy trust in companies and technology. They serve as warnings that, if left exposed, even the most private aspects of our lives—like our genetic makeup—can be used against us.
        Poor data privacy policies have serious effects on society. Data misuse may have many impacts, from discriminatory algorithms to targeted misinformation campaigns. For individuals, it can result in financial fraud or identity theft. On a societal level, unregulated data practices have the potential to increase inequality and create a culture of surveillance.
        As technology keeps influencing our daily lives, the challenge of how to combine utilizing data for growth with safeguarding the fundamental right to privacy arises. Both individuals and society as a whole depend on this balance. Stronger regulatory frameworks, transparent corporate practices, and a more informed public are all essential to address these issues.
        </p>
        <h2>The Data Collection Pipeline</h2>
        <p>
            Every online activity we engage in, such as using applications, reading websites, or even interacting with smart devices, adds to a complex data-gathering pipeline. Businesses collect data using a variety of techniques:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Applications that record user activity</li>
            <li>IoT sensors that keep an eye on physical surroundings</li>
            <li>Cookies that track online behavior (Mozilla, 2023)</li>
            <li>Offline sources like public records or in-store transactions (Privacy International, 2020)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            There is more to this data than that. It frequently ends up in the hands of data brokers, which are businesses that specialize in collecting private data from various sources to produce thorough user profiles. Marketers, advertisers, and even other businesses wishing to improve their services can purchase these profiles (Acxiom, 2021; Federal Trade Commission, 2014).
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Visualizing the Pipeline:</strong> In order to better understand the scope of data collection, the visualizations focus on the types and quantities of data produced by various activities:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Activity Timeline:</strong> Displays the frequency of sessions over time, offering insight into when users generate the most activity.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Generated by Category:</strong> This shows the breakdown of user interactions across different categories, emphasizing how personal preferences and habits are recorded.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Generated by Activity:</strong> Illustrates how individual actions contribute to the overall data pool, helping to reveal the scale of what companies collect.</li>
        </ul>

<p>In addition to highlighting the various applications of data, these visualizations offer a simple and engaging method to see the volume of data that people generate on a daily basis. It is easier to understand the amount of information spread and the privacy consequences when you are aware of the pipeline.</p>
<h2> How Personal Data is Used</h2>
<p>The digital experiences we have are influenced by the data generated by every online engagement we have. Whether it's recommendation systems that offer information based on our interests, decision-making algorithms that improve processes, or ads that are targeted at users based on their search history, data usage is critical to current technologies.
    The digital experiences we have every day are strongly shaped by user data. This data is often used in creating targeted advertising campaigns where a search for a product online will later result in seeing related ads on websites or social media. Research has shown that behavioral targeting makes ads much more effective (Lambrecht and Tucker, 2013). Other than advertising, data-driven solutions help businesses make intelligent decisions about loan and customer approval. However, these algorithms can have problems because they might unintentionally create biases, which raise ethical concerns (O'Neil, 2016). In an attempt to increase user engagement, services like Netflix and Spotify use user data to suggest shows, music, or products based on past interactions, making experiences more tailored (Gomez-Uribe and Hunt, 2015).
    </p>
        <!-- Sankey Diagram -->
        <div class="visualization-container">
            <iframe src="funnel_flow.html" width="1000" height="600" style="border: none;"></iframe>
        </div>
        <p>When a user knows how their data is used, they can see the pros and cons of making decisions based on data. The above Sankey diagram shows how users move through an online shopping process, from the homepage to making a purchase. It highlights where many people drop off, such as when they view products but do not complete their purchase, indicating the common issue of cart abandonment. This visual shows how businesses utilize user behavior data to improve their processes. For example, they can make the checkout flow easier or send special offers to users in order to keep them from leaving. These insights can make the user experience better and help businesses work more efficiently. However, they also show how much companies monitor and study user actions, which brings up concerns about balancing personalization and privacy.</p>
<h2>Data Misuse and Breaches</h2>
<p>Data breaches have been very serious in the past few years. For instance, the 2014 Yahoo data breach saw over 1 billion user accounts compromised. This is one of the largest data breaches ever, and it exposed important personal information such as names, email addresses, and passwords (Perlroth, 2016). Similarly, in 2021, LinkedIn suffered a massive breach when 700 million user records were put up for sale online. This indicates that even popular, well-established platforms can be unsafe (Lyons, 2021).
    These breaches have serious consequences for both individuals and organizations. Most commonly, individuals suffer identity theft and financial fraud, while companies spend money on recovery to regain trust, elevate security, and face resultant litigation. According to the Ponemon Institute, Cost of a Data Breach Report, 2022, the average cost of a data breach worldwide is now more than $4 million per breach (Ponemon Institute, 2022).
    These breaches show problems with how data is used, not just the financial effects. Algorithms and data systems can have biases and make inequalities worse, adding to the harm from breaches. Visualizations like the interactive timeline below show how these breaches happen across time, linking incidents to the amount of records lost and giving information on the way breaches occur. A closer look at these incidents shows that in a world growing more connected, the only way to safeguard user privacy is through strong data security measures.

<h2>Data Privacy Laws Around the World</h2>
<p>In the past few years, data privacy laws have come a long way, reflecting the growing need for the protection of personal information in our increasingly digital world. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union, established in 2018, has been a global standard for privacy, as it emphasizes giving users more control over their data and holds companies accountable with strict penalties for violations (GDPR Info, n.d.). Similarly, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) sets a precedent for privacy in the United States by granting Californians the right to access, delete, and opt out of having their personal information sold (California Office of the Attorney General, n.d.). The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) protects private health information in the healthcare industry (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, n.d.). However, not every country has such comprehensive laws. With progressive laws like the General Data Privacy Law (LGPD), nations like Brazil have led the way, but others remain far behind, leaving gaps in global data protection (UNCTAD, n.d.). These laws demonstrate that one of the major issues of today is striking a balance between the advantages of technological progress and the protection of individual rights.</p>

<h2>Taking Control of Your Data: Empowering Privacy Strategies</h2>
<p>In the current age of technology, protecting your personal information is more important than ever. Simple precautionary measures such as using a Virtual Private Network (VPN), controlling app permissions, and enabling two-factor authentication can significantly lower your vulnerability to data dangers. VPNs are a great security tool because they encrypt your internet connection, shielding your online activities from hackers. Additionally, digital footprints can be reduced by limiting personal information provided on social media platforms and disabling cookies.</p>

The interactive scenario builder empowers readers to simulate different combinations of privacy measures and evaluate their collective impact. These practical steps not only enhance personal data privacy but also contribute to a safer digital ecosystem.
    </p>

    <h2>Future Trends in Data Privacy: A Look Ahead</h2>
    <p>Due to the rapid changes occurring, the digital world will provide data privacy with new issues and innovative solutions. Blockchain technology has accelerated the development of decentralized data storage, one of the fastest-growing trends. By eliminating major points of failure, this approach improves data security and reduces the likelihood of extensive breaches (Shah and Jani, 2018). By eliminating major points of failure, this approach improves data security and reduces the likelihood of extensive breaches (Shah and Jani, 2018). However, as AI and predictive analytics become more complex, ethical concerns concerning these technologies become more obvious. Concerns about fairness, responsibility, and potential abuse are raised by AI's capacity to forecast actions or choices based on personal data (Binns, 2018).
        Looking forward, as the number of devices connected by IoCT increases, privacy issues will likely become more apparent. Since data is being secured by billions of devices, new solutions must be innovative and built on edge computing and more efficient encryption (Li et al., 2018). Since data is being secured by billions of devices, new solutions must be innovative and built on edge computing and more efficient encryption (Li et al., 2018). Similarly, governments and corporations may be forced to adopt stronger regulations and related technologies as a result of increased public awareness and advocacy for improved privacy protection in many countries (UNCTAD, 2021).
        This section's aggregated dashboard presents the audience with an interactive overview of key trends, data, and insights. Filters centered on blockchain, decentralized storage, or AI ethics allow users to explore a broader view of the factors influencing data privacy in the future. As a result, this article concludes on the future perspectives of innovating fast and working together in order to protect our privacy in this fast-changing digital world.
